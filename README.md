Dynamic Time Warping Clustering with LB_Keogh
=============================================

This is an example repository for how to cluster time series using DTW with the LB_Keogh lower-bounding method. This implementation uses K-Means clustering (model as DTWClustering), an unsupervised clustering approach. If enough interest arises, I will show how to perform supervised KNN using these computations.
